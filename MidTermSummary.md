# Assignment 5 (Midterm): Risk, Tech, and Earnings over the S&P

In this study, we report on the findings of three topics 1. financial risk 2. Technology and 3. Earnings growth. To assess the sentiment around these specific topics we created a list to describe positive and negative sentiments surrounding each topic for every firm. These sentiments were described by a regex variable. Regex is a defined function made in order to identify the “closeness” or proximity of one word to another in a text with “max_words_between”. These created variables are used to answer the research question on how does the development or focus of technology in modern day firms interact with a firm's earning’s growth/overall success and what is more tied to that earning between increased financial risk / leverage opportunities or technological advancement?

Findings conclude that there is a large correlation in 10k's for the S&P 500 companies in the spheres of both tech growth, risk growth, and earnings growth. Specifically, we find that high mentions of tech coincide more so with increases in risk than earnings growth does. Essentially, answering the question whether there is more association to earnings growth via Tech than Financial risk iin modern finance.
